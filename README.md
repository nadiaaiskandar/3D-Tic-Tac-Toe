# 3D-Tic-Tac-Toe
This is a 3D 4x4x4 Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in Java, featuring a bitboard-based board representation and a computer opponent powered by the
Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning. The game supports interactive console gameplay, advanced AI heuristics, and move management features.
# Features: 
AI Opponent: Uses Minimax with alpha-beta pruning to determine optimal moves.
Heuristic Evaluation: AI evaluates board positions using scoring for 2-in-a-row, 3-in-a-row, forks, and potential wins.
0 Bitboard Representation: Efficient board state storage using 64-bit integers.
